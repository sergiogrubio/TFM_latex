# testDEX latex

testDEX is a simple DEX using the Elrond network. University master's degree final project (cybersecurity/UOC).

In this repo you'll find the thesis of the project (the latex template was made by [UOC](https://www.uoc.edu/)). You have also a repo for the [dApp](https://github.com/sergiogrubio/TFM_dapp), another one for the [smart contract](https://github.com/sergiogrubio/TFM_smart_contract) and, finally, a repo with a [script to test Elrond's network performance](https://github.com/sergiogrubio/TFM_stats).

The thesis is written in catalan. I compile it using Texmaker (Ubuntu). If you get this error "I couldn't open style file IEEEtran.bst" you must install the packate "texlive-publishers":

```
sudo apt install texlive-publishers
```

The thesis was finally [published in the college website](https://openaccess.uoc.edu/handle/10609/146212)
